## About 

This is the **Module 04 Challenge Project**. The point of this project was to add my new knowledge of Web-APIs and previous knowledge of Javascript, CSSS, and HMTL to a project made from scratch. The finished product is an Diary that tracks and displays your entries using the local storage to set items on one page then pulling them on the other.

## The Purpose 

The purpose of this application is to give users a space to share their thoughts. It asks for who is writing in it, what their topic of the day is and what happened relating to that topic. Also allowing them to make multiple entries that display on a seperate page.

## Usage
 
 When the user first loads up this application, they will be prompted to write about whatever is on their mind. They also will have a button on top of the page that when clicked will trigger the dark mode feature. Once they have filled out the form and press the 'submit' button, they will be directed to the next page that will then display their entry for them to see. On that page they also have the dark mode button to press. At the bottom of the entries page, they will find the portfolio and contact information of the author of the application. Once they are finished admiring their first post, they are able to click on the 'back' button that will then direct them back to the original page where they are able to add more diary entries until they are satisfied. Each entry will take them back to the page where they are being displayed.
